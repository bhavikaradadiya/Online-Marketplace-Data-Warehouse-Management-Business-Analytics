## 📊 Sample SQL Queries

### ⭐ Vendor Sales Ranking (Window Function)

        SELECT v.V_ID, v.Name AS VendorName,

       SUM(op.Quentity * pv.Price) AS TotalSales,
       
      RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(op.Quentity * pv.Price) DESC) AS SalesRank
      
      FROM order_product op
      
      JOIN product_vendor pv ON op.P_ID = pv.P_ID
      
      JOIN vendor v ON pv.V_ID = v.V_ID
      
      GROUP BY v.V_ID;

**Result**
